Redirect
Redirects the user to a different page.

Redirects can be added to the app in place of "real" pages. These are useful for cases where you want to add valid links to the app, but don't want to display a page at that URL. They redirect users to another page the instant they would be opened.

Redirects are passed directly to the app during construction, like so:

Python

import rio

app = rio.App(
    build=lambda: rio.Column(
        rio.Text("Welcome to my app!"),
        rio.PageView(grow_y=True),
    ),
    pages=[
        rio.ComponentPage(
            name="Home",
            url_segment="",
            build=lambda: rio.Text("This is the home page"),
        ),
        rio.ComponentPage(
            name="Subpage",
            url_segment="subpage",
            build=lambda: rio.Text("This is a subpage"),
        ),
        rio.Redirect(
            url_segment="old-page",
            target="/subpage",
        ),
    ],
)

app.run_in_browser()
