UserSettings
Base class for persistent user settings.

When creating an app or website you'll often want to store some values so that you can access them the next time the user visits your app. A typical example are configuration values set by the user - you wouldn't want to ask for these every time.

Rio makes it easy to store and retrieve such values. Create a class that inherits from UserSettings, and attach it to the Session. That's it! Rio will automatically store and retrieve the values for you.

Python

# Create a dataclass that inherits from rio.UserSettings. This indicates to
# Rio that these are settings and should be persisted.
class MySettings(rio.UserSettings):
    language: str = "en"

# Attach the settings to the app. This way the settings will be available in
# all sessions. They will be loaded automatically from the user whenever
# they connect or start the app.
app = rio.App(
    ...,
    default_attachments=[
        MySettings(),
    ],
)
You can modify the settings from anywhere in your app. Rio will detect changes and persist them automatically:

Python

# ... somewhere in your code
settings = self.session[MySettings]

# Read any values you need to
print(settings.language)  # "en"

# Assignments will be automatically detected and saved
settings.language = "de"
Warning: Since settings are stored on the user's device, special considerations apply. Some countries have strict privacy laws regulating what you can store with/without the user's consent. Make sure you are familiar with the legal situation before going wild and storing everything you can think of.

Warning: Since settings are stored on the user's device, you should never trust them to be valid. A malicious actor could modify them to intentionally trigger bugs in your app. Always validate the values before using them.

If provided, the settings file will contain a section with this name. This allows you to keep the configuration file organized. If None, the settings will be stored outside of any section.
