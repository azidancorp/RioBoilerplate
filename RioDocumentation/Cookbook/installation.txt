How do I install Rio?
Rio is available on PyPI, so you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install rio-ui
```

If you encounter issues with the above command, try one of these alternatives:

```bash
python -m pip install rio-ui
python3 -m pip install rio-ui
py -m pip install rio-ui
```

After installation, a `rio` command will be available in your terminal for creating and managing projects. If the command isn't available, try running Rio through Python:

```bash
python -m rio
python3 -m rio
py -m rio
```
