Always refer closely to the documentation in the tagged pages for rio components, paying specific attention to the arguments in the constructor.
Example: "git commit -am "message"; git push" should be output format of instructions to make a commit and push command in the terminal
All plotly charts should have `update_layout(template='plotly_dark')` applied.
Only change exactly what is required for the request, nothing more, nothing less.
Do not use "children" as an argument in any rio component, place components directly.
