Holds information regarding a mouse enter event.

This is a simple dataclass that stores useful information for when the user moves the mouse over a component. You'll typically receive this as argument in on_mouse_enter events.

Attributes
x

The x coordinate of the mouse when the event was triggered, relative to the left side of the window.

y
float
The y coordinate of the mouse when the event was triggered, relative to the top of the window. (So a larger y means further down.)
