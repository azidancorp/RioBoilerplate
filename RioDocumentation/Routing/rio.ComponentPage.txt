ComponentPage
A routable page in a Rio app.

Rio apps can consist of many pages. You might have a welcome page, a settings page, a login, and so on. ComponentPage components contain all information needed to display those pages, as well as to navigate between them.

This is not just specific to websites. Apps might, for example, have a settings page, a profile page, a help page, and so on.

Pages are passed directly to the app during construction, like so:

Python

import rio

app = rio.App(
    build=lambda: rio.Column(
        rio.Text("Welcome to my app!"),
        rio.PageView(grow_y=True),
    ),
    pages=[
        rio.ComponentPage(
            name="Home",
            url_segment="",
            build=lambda: rio.Text("This is the home page"),
        ),
        rio.ComponentPage(
            name="Subpage",
            url_segment="subpage",
            build=lambda: rio.Text("This is a subpage"),
        ),
    ],
)

app.run_in_browser()
This will display "This is the home page" when navigating to the root URL, but "This is a subpage" when navigating to "/subpage". Note that on both pages the text "Welcome to my page!" is displayed above the page content. That's because it's not part of the PageView.

For additional details, please refer to the how-to guide: https://rio.dev/docs/howto/multiple-pages.

Attributes
name
str
A human-readable name for the page. While the page itself doesn't use this value directly, it serves as important information for debugging, as well as other components such as navigation bars.

url_segment
str
The URL segment at which this page should be displayed. For example, if this is "subpage", then the page will be displayed at "https://yourapp.com/subpage". If this is "", then the page will be displayed at the root URL.

build
Callable[[], rio.Component]
A callback that is called when this page is displayed. It should return a Rio component.

icon
str
The name of an icon to associate with the page. While the page itself doesn't use this value directly, it serves as additional information for other components such as navigation bars.

children
Sequence[rio.ComponentPage | rio.Redirect]
A list of child pages. These pages will be displayed when navigating to a sub-URL of this page. For example, if this page's url_segment is "page1", and it has a child page with url_segment "page2", then the child page will be displayed at "https://yourapp.com/page1/page2".

guard
Callable[[rio.GuardEvent], None | rio.URL | str] | None
A callback that is called before this page is displayed. It can prevent users from accessing pages which they are not allowed to see. For example, you may want to redirect users to your login page if they are trying to access their profile page without being logged in.

The callback should return None if the user is allowed to access the page, or a string or rio.URL if the user should be redirected to a different page.

meta_tags
dict[str, str]
A dictionary of meta tags to include in the page's HTML. These are used by search engines and social media sites to display information about your page.
