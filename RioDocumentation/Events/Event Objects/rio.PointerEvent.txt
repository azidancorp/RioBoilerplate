PointerEvent
Holds information regarding a pointer event.

This is a simple dataclass that stores useful information for when the user interacts with a component using a mouse, touch, or other pointer-style device. You'll receive this as argument in a variety of pointer events.

Attributes

float
The y coordinate of the pointer relative to the window. The origin is the top-left corner of the window, with larger y values meaning further down.

float
The x coordinate of the pointer relative to the PointerEventListener component. The origin is the top-left corner of the component, with larger x values meaning further to the right.

component_y
float
