page
This decorator creates a page (complete with URL, icon, etc) that displays the decorated component. All parameters are optional, and if omitted, sensible defaults will be inferred based on the name of the decorated class.

In order to create a "root" page, set the url_segment to an empty string:

Python

@rio.page(
    url_segment="",
)
class HomePage(rio.Component):
    def build(self):
        return rio.Text(
            "Welcome to my website",
            style="heading1",
        )
For additional details, please refer to the how-to guide Multiple Pages.

Signature
def page(
    *, 
    url_segment: str | None = None, 
    name: str | None = None, 
    icon: str = 'rio/logo:color', 
    guard: Callable[[rio.GuardEvent], None | rio.URL | str] | None = None, 
    meta_tags: dict[str, str] | None = None, 
    order: int | None = None, 
) -> Any

url_segment
str | None
The URL segment at which this page should be displayed. For example, if this is "subpage", then the page will be displayed at "https://yourapp.com/subpage". If this is "", then the page will be displayed at the root URL.

name
str | None
A human-readable name for the page. While the page itself doesn't use this value directly, it serves as important information for debugging, as well as other components such as navigation bars.

icon
str
The name of an icon to associate with the page. While the page itself doesn't use this value directly, it serves as additional information for other components such as navigation bars.

guard
Callable[[rio.GuardEvent], None | rio.URL | str] | None
A callback that is called before this page is displayed. It can prevent users from accessing pages which they are not allowed to see. For example, you may want to redirect users to your login page if they are trying to access their profile page without being logged in.

The callback should return None if the user is allowed to access the page, or a string or rio.URL if the user should be redirected to a different page.

meta_tags
dict[str, str] | None
A dictionary of meta tags to include in the page's HTML. These are used by search engines and social media sites to display information about your page.

order
int | None
An int that controls the order of this page relative to its siblings. Similar to the name, this is relevant for navigation bars.
