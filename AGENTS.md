# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
The Rio app lives in `app/app`. `pages/` registers routeable components via `@rio.page`; `components/` contains reusable UI widgets; `scripts/` stores helpers such as HTML loaders and OTP utilities; `data/` and `assets/` house seed content and static files. Authentication and persistence glue sits in `permissions.py` and `persistence.py`. Prototype HTML/JS lives in `app/JSPages`. Reference material and deployment playbooks are in `RioDocumentation/` and `DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`. Manage dependencies through `requirements.txt`; keep the committed `venv/` aligned with that file.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Create a clean environment with `python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate` (or `venv\\Scripts\\activate` on Windows) and install deps via `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Run `rio run` for the auto-reloading dev server defined by `app/rio.toml`. Use `rio run --port 8000 --release` to mirror production, especially before deployment. Utility scripts like `server_sync.py` and `split_documentation.py` help sync assets and docs when packaging.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Use 4-space indentation, type hints, and dataclass-friendly patterns (`app/pages/home.py`). Modules, dirs, and functions are snake_case; Rio component classes are `PascalCase`. Keep asset filenames lowercase-with-hyphens. Document any non-obvious script with a short docstring explaining its side effects. Avoid inline state mutation inside buildersâ€”prefer explicit helper methods that update component attributes.

## Testing Guidelines
Automated coverage is light today. Add new tests under `app/tests/` (create if missing) using `pytest` with files named `test_<feature>.py`; run them with `pytest`. Exercise interactive flows by launching `rio run --release` and walking through login, persistence, and 2FA utilities (see `scripts/test2fa.py` and `scripts/test_qr.py`). Record edge cases such as failed authentication or expired tokens in your test notes.

If you have made any changes to the rio frontend, then smoke test using `rio run --port 8XXX` from the first app directory that contains rio.toml - with a 5s timeout, and then fix errors until it runs fine.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Follow the existing concise imperative style (`remove redundant reset password page`). Each commit should bundle one logical change with related docs or data updates. PRs must explain user-facing impact, enumerate tests run (`rio run --release`, `pytest`), link issues, and attach screenshots/GIFs for UI changes. Request a maintainer review before merge.

## Security & Configuration Tips
Load secrets from an untracked `.env` (supported via `python-dotenv`) and never commit credentials. Re-check guards whenever updating `permissions.py`, and audit persistence changes for SQL injection and session leakage. After upgrading packages, regenerate `requirements.txt` (`pip freeze > requirements.txt`) so deployment stays reproducible.
