ColorPicker
Allows the user to pick a RGB(A) color.

ColorPicker is a component that allows the user to input a color. It displays a combination of colorful areas and sliders that the user can interact with to select a color, and optionally also an opacity slider to pick opacity.

Constructor
ColorPicker(
    color: rio.Color, 
    *, 
    pick_opacity: bool = False, 
    on_change: rio.EventHandler[rio.ColorChangeEvent] = None, 
    # Inherited from `rio.Component`
    key: str | int | None = None, 
    min_width: float = 0, 
    min_height: float = 0, 
    grow_x: bool = False, 
    grow_y: bool = False, 
    align_x: float | None = None, 
    align_y: float | None = None, 
    margin_left: float | None = None, 
    margin_top: float | None = None, 
    margin_right: float | None = None, 
    margin_bottom: float | None = None, 
    margin_x: float | None = None, 
    margin_y: float | None = None, 
    margin: float | None = None, 
)
color
rio.Color

The color that the user has picked.

pick_opacity
bool

Whether to allow the user to pick opacity. If False, the opacity slider will be hidden and the color value will be forced to be fully opaque.

on_change
rio.EventHandler[rio.ColorChangeEvent]

This event is triggered whenever the user changes the color.

key
str | int | None

A unique identifier for this component. If two components with the same key are present during reconciliation they will be considered the same component and their state will be preserved. If no key is specified, reconciliation falls back to a less precise method, by comparing the location of the component in the component tree.

min_width
float

The minimum amount of horizontal space this component should request during layouting. The component will never be smaller than this size.

Please note that the space a Component receives during layouting may not match the request. As a general rule, for example, containers try to pass on all available space to children. If you really want a Component to only take up as much space as requested, consider specifying an alignment.

Sizes are measured in "font heights", so a width of 1 is the same as the height of a single line of text.

min_height
float

The minimum amount of vertical space this component should request during layouting. The component will never be smaller than this size.

Please note that the space a Component receives during layouting may not match the request. As a general rule, for example, containers try to pass on all available space to children. If you really want a Component to only take up as much space as requested, consider specifying an alignment.

Sizes are measured in "font heights", so a width of 1 is the same as the height of a single line of text.

grow_x
bool

Whether this component should request all the superfluous horizontal space available in its parent. Containers normally divide up any extra space evenly between their children. However, if components have grow_x, some containers (such as rio.Row) will give all remaining space to those components first.

grow_y
bool

Whether this component should request all the superfluous vertical space available in its parent. Containers normally divide up any extra space evenly between their children. However, if components have grow_y, some containers (such as rio.Column) will give all remaining space to those components first.

align_x
float | None

How this component should be aligned horizontally, if it receives more space than it requested. This can be a number between 0 and 1, where 0 means left-aligned, 0.5 means centered, and 1 means right-aligned.

align_y
float | None

How this component should be aligned vertically, if it receives more space than it requested. This can be a number between 0 and 1, where 0 means top-aligned, 0.5 means centered, and 1 means bottom-aligned.

margin_left
float | None

The left margin around this component. If multiple conflicting margins are specified this one will be used, since it's the most specific. If for example margin_left and margin are both specified, margin_left is used for the left side, while the other sides use margin. Sizes are measured in "font heights", so a margin of 1 is the height of a single line of text.

margin_top
float | None

The top margin around this component. If multiple conflicting margins are specified this one will be used, since it's the most specific. If for example margin_top and margin are both specified, margin_top is used for the top side, while the other sides use margin. Sizes are measured in "font heights", so a margin of 1 is the height of a single line of text.

margin_right
float | None

The right margin around this component. If multiple conflicting margins are specified this one will be used, since it's the most specific. If for example margin_right and margin are both specified, margin_right is used for the right side, while the other sides use margin. Sizes are measured in "font heights", so a margin of 1 is the height of a single line of text.

margin_bottom
float | None

The bottom margin around this component. If multiple conflicting margins are specified this one will be used, since it's the most specific. If for example margin_bottom and margin are both specified, margin_bottom is used for the bottom side, while the other sides use margin. Sizes are measured in "font heights", so a margin of 1 is the height of a single line of text.

margin_x
float | None

The horizontal margin around this component. This is a shorthand for setting margin_left and margin_right to the same value. If multiple conflicting margins are specified the most specific one wins. If for example margin_x and margin_left are both specified, margin_left is used for the left side, while the other side uses margin_x. Sizes are measured in "font heights", so a margin of 1 is the height of a single line of text.

margin_y
float | None

The vertical margin around this component. This is a shorthand for setting margin_top and margin_bottom to the same value. If multiple conflicting margins are specified the most specific one wins. If for example margin_y and margin_top are both specified, margin_top is used for the top side, while the other side uses margin_y. Sizes are measured in "font heights", so a margin of 1 is the height of a single line of text.

margin
float | None

The margin around this component. This is a shorthand for setting margin_left, margin_top, margin_right and margin_bottom to the same value. If multiple conflicting margins are specified the most specific one wins. If for example margin and margin_left are both specified, margin_left is used for the left side, while the other sides use margin. Sizes are measured in "font heights", so a margin of 1 is the height of a single line of text.

Examples
You can use attribute bindings to access the selected color. Here's an example colorizing an icon with the selected color:

Python

class MyComponent(rio.Component):
    color: rio.Color = rio.Color.BLUE

    def build(self) -> rio.Component:
        return rio.Row(
            rio.ColorPicker(
                color=self.bind().color,
            ),
            rio.Icon(
                "material/star",
                fill=self.color,
            ),
        )
Alternatively, you can get the selected color by listening for change events:

Python

class MyComponent(rio.Component):
    selected_color: rio.Color = rio.Color.from_hex("#ff0000")  # Red

    def print_selected_color(self, event: rio.ColorChangeEvent) -> None:
        self.selected_color = event.color
        print(f"You have selected #{event.color.hex}")

    def build(self) -> rio.Component:
        return rio.ColorPicker(
            color=self.selected_color,
            on_change=self.print_selected_color,
        )
