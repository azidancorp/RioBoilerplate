PointerMoveEvent
Holds information regarding a pointer move event.

This is a simple dataclass that stores useful information for when the user moves the pointer. You'll typically receive this as argument in on_pointer_move events.

Attributes

Literal['mouse', 'touch']
What sort of pointer triggered the event. Can be either "mouse" or "touch".

button
Literal['left', 'middle', 'right'] | None
The mouse button that was pressed, if any. For mouse events (pointer_type=="mouse"), this is either "left", "middle", or "right". For other events, this is None.

window_x
float
The x coordinate of the pointer relative to the window. The origin is the top-left corner of the window, with larger x values meaning further to the right.

window_y
float
The y coordinate of the pointer relative to the window. The origin is the top-left corner of the window, with larger y values meaning further down.

component_x
float
The x coordinate of the pointer relative to the PointerEventListener component. The origin is the top-left corner of the component, with larger x values meaning further to the right.

component_y
float
The y coordinate of the pointer relative to the PointerEventListener component. The origin is the top-left corner of the component, with larger y values meaning further down.

relative_x
float
How far the pointer has moved horizontally since the last time the event was triggered.

relative_y
float
How far the pointer has moved vertically since the last time the event was triggered.
