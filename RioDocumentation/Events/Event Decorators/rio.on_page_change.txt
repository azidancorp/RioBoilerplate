on_page_change
Triggered whenever the session changes pages.

Makes the decorated method an event handler for on_page_change events. The method will be called whenever the session navigates to a new page.

If you want your code to run both when the component was first created and when the page changes, you can combine this decorator with __post_init__ or on_populate.

This decorator can be used on both synchronous as well as asynchronous methods.

Signature
@rio.event.on_page_change
Example
Python

class UrlDisplay(rio.Component):
    current_url: rio.URL = rio.URL()

    def __post_init__(self):
        self.current_url = self.session.active_page_url

    @rio.event.on_page_change
    def on_page_change(self):
        self.current_url = self.session.active_page_url

    def build(self):
        return rio.Text(f"You're currently on {self.current_url}")
